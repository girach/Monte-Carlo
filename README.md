# Monte-Carlo
Generation of Gamma Random Variables using Generalised Exponential Distribution...via Acception-Rejection Technique.This folader contains the R files for various types of algorithms for generating Gamma Random variables with scale parameter(<1).All algorithms are coded in R in repesctive folders and brief description is given in the document.pdf in which all algorithms are explained and compared thoroughly.
